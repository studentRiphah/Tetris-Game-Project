Step 1: Install Python and Pygame

First, make sure Python and Pygame are installed on your system. Open the terminal and execute:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install pygame

Step 2: Create a Project Directory

Set up a directory to store your Tetris game code:

mkdir ~/tetris-game
cd ~/tetris-game

Step 3: Write the Tetris Code

Create a new Python file for your game code, e.g., tetris.py:

nano tetris.py

Then, paste the Tetris game code into tetris.py and save the file. If you have specific code ready, enter it directly. If you need a sample code, let me know, and I can provide one.
Step 4: Run the Tetris Game

Once the code is ready, run the game with the following command:

python3 tetris.py
